For windows navigate to command prompt and type ```npm -v``` or ```node -v``` and check for version
In case of version not shown we need to install node using the prebuilt installer from [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
Select the node version and operating system.
Make sure that the Path is set in the environment variables till the node folder (eg: C:\Program Files\nodejs\ If node is installed using the installer file it will automatically set the path)
