For windows navigate to command prompt and type ```java -version``` and check for version
In case of version not shown we need to install Java from oracle website. For this project we have used Jdk 14.0.1

Later setup the environment variables such as JAVA_HOME(Path till the jdk folder eg: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.1) variable and PATH (path till bin of jdk eg: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin)
For confirmation check ```java -version``` in command prompt
